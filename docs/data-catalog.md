# Data catalog

**Every data source in the project, and how to get it in one line.**

You never call NASA, NWS, ArcGIS or Earth Engine yourself. The data pipeline does that, cleans the result into one standard format (**Evidence**), caches it, keeps it fresh, and hands it to you:

```python
from inland_worker.data import get_evidence, get_reference_layer

result = await get_evidence("firms", area=aoi, date_range=dates)   # any provider_id below
result.items       # list[Evidence]: same shape for every source
result.freshness   # Fresh | Stale(age, reason) | Missing(reason)
```

- **Frontend (S1, S2):** you don't call this. You get the same Evidence objects from the Go API (`GET /v1/analyses/{id}/evidence`), and the mock API serves the examples in `contracts/examples/`.
- **Try it now:** `make worker-install`, then `INLAND_DATA_MODE=fixture uv run python -c "..."` (see `apps/worker/README.md`).
- **Offline:** set `INLAND_DATA_MODE=fixture` and every source below returns recorded real data. No API keys needed.

## The four source patterns

Every source is one of four kinds. The lead builds the **first of each kind** (the *reference connector*), so every other source has a working example to copy.

| Pattern | What's tricky about it | Reference (lead) | Copy it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Keyed API** (CSV/JSON + API key) | Keeping the key secret, parsing, timestamps | `connectors/fire/firms.py` | CIMIS, AirNow |
| **ArcGIS feature service** | Paging through results, ArcGIS JSON → GeoJSON | `connectors/fire/wfigs.py` | CAL FIRE, county boundary, hazard zones, county layers |
| **Follow-the-link API** | Safely following URLs the API returns | `connectors/weather/nws_forecast.py` | NWS alerts, USGS |
| **Earth Engine compute** | Auth, timeouts, caching server-side computation | `kit/compute.py` | All Sentinel-2 / Landsat / ECOSTRESS / GOES work (S6) |

To add a source: `make new-connector NAME=<id> GROUP=<fire|weather> PATTERN=<keyed|arcgis|follow_link>` copies the matching reference into place. Then change the URL and the field mapping, record fixtures, and run the tests. Full details: [connector guide](connectors/connector-guide.md).

## What every Evidence item always has

Whatever the source, every item carries: `evidence_type` · `source` · `observed_at` (when the source saw it) · `retrieved_at` (when we fetched it) · `geometry` (GeoJSON, WGS84) · `properties` (with units) · `quality_flags` · `limitations` · `source_url`. Schema: `contracts/evidence.schema.json`.

## Provider specs

Endpoint, fields, limits and limitations for each source: [docs/connectors/providers/](connectors/providers/).
